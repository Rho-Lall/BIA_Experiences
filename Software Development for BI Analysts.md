#Software Development for BI Analysts

As a data scientist you are probably most familiar with software development for personal use: firing up a python notebook importing pandas and completing a task using SciKit Learn. In practice data science is used to meet the needs of:
a specific client, via custom software
or a group of potential users, via commercial and open source software. 

Both of these solutions require software development and software engineering.

####What is the difference?

A developer focuses on creating functional software **that someone else will use**. An engineer oversees the development system as a whole using a systematic approach founded on engineering paradigms. As a data professional your job will overlap both these responsibilities. Good advice is to focus on learning the development side first.

####Some terms you will want to google:

- Agile (vs waterfall)
- Development Stack (frontend, backend)
- Restful API
- Microservices architecture (vs monolithic)
- Model View Controller
- abstraction , encapsulation, & inheritance
- [markdown][1]

####These are some terms you will want to know on the engineering side:
- Data Warehousing
- Data model
- Star schema vs denormalized
- OLTP vs OLAP
- Columnar Data Storage
