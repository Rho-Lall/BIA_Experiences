# BIA_Experiences

Experience in a bottle: A collection of stories preserved over time which contributed to becoming an experienced data scientist / BIA.

There is a difference between academic projects and delivering results in the real world. During interviews for my first business intelligence gig, that became very apparent. Hiring managers want experience. They have a problem and they are looking for a candidate with solutions.

I'm writing this for students and first year bIAs to help them get up the rungs of experience that much faster as well as for myself to document my own progress of how far I have come.
